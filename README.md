# Typed Tailwind Â· [typed-tw.now.sh](https://typed-tw.now.sh)

Utility-first CSS framework, statically typed.

* [Usage](#usage)
* [FAQ](#faq)
* [License](#license)

## Usage

1. Go to [typed-tw.now.sh](https://typed-tw.now.sh) and paste your Tailwind [configuration](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration) into the first panel.
2. Save the generated code in the second panel as a TypeScript file in your codebase.
3. Import the `Style` function from that file and use its ([chain-able](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_chaining)) methods:

```tsx
import { Style } from "style";

const Foo = () => (
  <p className={Style().textBlue().fontBold().$()}>
    Bold, blue text
  </p>
);
```

### Does it work without TypeScript?

Yes. You can always compile the generated file to JS, optionally with a [declaration file](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/introduction.html):

```sh
tsc --declaration style.ts
```

This way, you still get full [code completion](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense), just no compile time type checking.

### Does it work with PurgeCSS?

Not yet. It requires a custom extractor, which is [planned](https://github.com/dvkndn/typed-tailwind/issues/2). In the meantime, try [remove unused values](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/controlling-file-size#removing-unused-theme-values).

### Does it work with custom plugins?

It's not officially supported yet but could work if your plugins are defined as inline anonymous functions (like in the [docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/plugins)). Also see: [Does it work with custom classes](#oes-it-work-with-custom-classes).

### Does it work with custom classes?

Yes. The result is simply a source file, so feel free to modify it anyway you want:

```typescript
// style.ts

class SStyle {
  /* ... */
  
  // Add your custom ones:
  textShadow(): SStyle { return this.add("text-shadow"); }
}
```

### Is there any performance issue?

Out of the box, it's a run time solution so it's slower and use more memory than typing the class strings directly. However, this can be improved:

- Move the calls out of the renders. The work is still done at run time, but just once at start-up instead of every render.

    ```tsx
    const styles = Style().fontBold().textBlue().$();
    
    const Foo = () => <p className={styles} />;
    ```
- Use a build plugin to handle all the works at compile time. It does not exist yet but is [planned](https://github.com/dvkndn/typed-tailwind/issues/1).

### Is there a CLI?

It's [planned](https://github.com/dvkndn/typed-tailwind/issues/3).
